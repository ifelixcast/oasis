# Whim!

Whim! : Spontaneous activities others can join at the moment
Stack: Expo (React Native) + TypeScript + Expo Router, with Supabase for auth and the database.

The skeleton covers the core loop: **sign up / sign in → post an event → see open events → join one → see your profile and counts.**
Everything else (map, radius, places, reviews, notifications, badges, verification) is left to build on top.

### Database
Run `server/supabase/setup.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. It does four things:

1. **Auto-creates a `profiles` row** whenever someone signs up. Without this, inserts into
   `events` fail, because `events.profile_id` points at a profile that doesn't exist yet.
   For it to work, `profiles.id` must reference `auth.users.id`, and every other column on
   `profiles` (username, name, etc.) must be nullable or have a default.
2. **Creates the `profile_stats` view** for hosted/attended counts.
3. **Turns on RLS and adds policies.**
4. **Adds the `interests` column** to `profiles`, shown as the "Into" chips on the profile page.

Before running it, check that the names in the SQL match tables. It assumes
`profiles`, `places`, `events`, `event_buddies`, `reviews`, with every person column named
`profile_id`. If your reviews table is still called `review`, rename it or edit the SQL.

### Run it

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go. Sign up, post an event, and check that it shows up on the Nearby tab.

**Note** Supabase Auth requires email confirmation by default, so after signing up you'll
get an email before you can sign in. For development you can turn this off under
Authentication → Providers → Email.

### Splitting the work

Four areas that can mostly run in parallel once the skeleton is up:

- **Auth and profiles**: sign-up flow, profile editing, avatars, viewing other people's profiles.
- **Events**: feed, create form, event detail, join/leave, status changes.
- **Location and map**: device location, radius filter, map screen, places.
- **Database and backend**: schema changes, RLS policies, views, triggers, notifications.

Keep `lib/types.ts` in sync with the database. Whoever changes a table updates the type in the same commit.
